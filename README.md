## ⚙️ Key Features

### 📖 Scroll-Driven Case Studies

Every project follows a structured narrative arc:

```
Problem → Discovery → Decision → How It Works → Result
```

- **Desktop** — scroll-driven chapter transitions with GSAP + ScrollTrigger
- **Mobile** — compact, viewport-aware sections with explicit interaction states
- **Accessibility** — reduced-motion users receive stable, fully readable alternatives

### 🤖 Grounded Portfolio Assistant

An AI assistant that answers questions about Henry's work, services, skills, and availability. The React interface calls a Python serverless endpoint that retrieves relevant sections from the canonical public context, requests a structured answer from OpenAI, and falls back to OpenRouter when required.

The backend also validates every proposed action against an allowlist. Navigation, booking, project inquiry, and project-view actions are returned as UI proposals; the model cannot execute them directly.

| Component | Path |
|:--|:--|
| Public knowledge base | [`henry-context.md`](knowledge/henry-context.md) |
| Retrieval & response logic | [`assistant.py`](api/_lib/assistant.py) |
| Python configuration and action allowlist | [`config.py`](api/_lib/config.py) |
| API entry point | [`chat.py`](api/chat.py) |
| Client interface | [`PortfolioGuide.jsx`](src/v2/PortfolioGuide.jsx) |
| Local Vite-to-Python adapter | [`local-python-chat.js`](scripts/local-python-chat.js) |
| Assistant tests | [`test_chat_python.py`](tests/test_chat_python.py) |

Assistant request flow:

```text
Visitor → React chat panel → POST /api/chat → Python retrieval and safety layer
                                                ↓
                                    OpenAI → OpenRouter fallback
                                                ↓
                         Structured answer + validated UI action proposals
```

#### Chatbot evaluations

The versioned evaluation set at [`portfolio_chat_v1.json`](evals/portfolio_chat_v1.json) checks representative portfolio questions and actions. It covers grounded facts, retrieval relevance, unsupported pricing, assistant disclosure, prompt injection, evidence labels, booking, inquiry, and approved navigation.

```bash
# Free local/CI gate: retrieval, deterministic actions, schema, and evaluator tests
npm run eval:chat

# Full provider run: grades real OpenAI/OpenRouter answers and writes a JSON report
npm run eval:chat:live
```

Live reports include pass rates by dimension, average and p95 latency, provider/model information, token usage, returned messages, suggestions, and actions. Set `EVAL_INPUT_COST_PER_MILLION` and `EVAL_OUTPUT_COST_PER_MILLION` to add a cost estimate without hard-coding model prices in the repository. Generated reports are written to `eval-results/` and are not committed.

The [`Chat evaluations`](.github/workflows/chat-evals.yml) GitHub Actions workflow runs the free gate on relevant pushes and pull requests. A full live run can be started manually with the `run_live` option after adding `OPENAI_API_KEY` and/or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` as repository secrets.

### 📅 Live Booking

Retrieves real-time Cal.com availability and creates bookings after visitor confirmation.

| Endpoint | Path |
|:--|:--|
| Availability | `api/cal/slots.js` |
| Booking | `api/cal/book.js` |
| Verification | `api/cal/verify.js` |
| Booking UI | `src/v2/GuideBooking.jsx` |

### 📬 Contact & Project Intake

Visitors can send project inquiries directly or through the portfolio assistant. Forms use Formspree — no additional server-side env vars needed.

### Referral partner programme

The public programme at `/v2/referrals/` accepts applications for manually approved referral links. Approved partners sign in without a password at `/v2/referrals/dashboard/` to see clicks, enquiries, commission status, and a redacted payout method.

| Rule | Implementation |
|:--|:--|
| Gig or contract commission | 10% of the first cleared payment |
| Employment commission | 5% of the first cleared salary payment |
| Attribution | First approved referrer for 60 days |
| Clearance | 14 days after the first payment clears |
| Payouts | Nigerian/international bank transfer or USDT on TRON (TRC-20) |

The browser stores the first approved referral locally while the FastAPI endpoint also sets an HTTP-only attribution cookie. Every v2 project enquiry sends the referral code to Formspree and records a privacy-limited lead through `/api/referrals`. Supabase is never written to directly by the public browser.

Referral setup:

1. Create a Supabase project and run `supabase/migrations/202607220001_referral_campaign.sql` in its SQL editor.
2. Add the server and public Supabase values listed below to `.env` and Vercel.
3. In Supabase Auth URL Configuration, allow the production and local `/v2/referrals/dashboard/` redirect URLs used by passwordless email sign-in.
4. Approve an application by changing `referral_profiles.status` from `pending` to `approved` in the Supabase Table Editor.
5. When an enquiry becomes a client or hire, set its `referral_leads.status` to `won` and enter `opportunity_type`, `first_payment_amount`, `first_payment_currency`, and `first_payment_cleared_at`. The database creates the 5% or 10% commission automatically.
6. After clearance, record the payout by changing the commission to `paid` and adding `paid_at` plus a bank reference or TRON transaction hash in `payment_reference`.

Payout account details are available only through the server service role; partner dashboards receive a redacted display label. For a larger programme, move bank and wallet details to a dedicated encrypted payout provider before automating transfers.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22**, **npm**, and **Python 3.12+**

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Protagonist01/my-website.git
cd my-website
npm ci
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env       # on PowerShell: Copy-Item .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite. Both `/` and `/v2/` load the current portfolio.

During local development, Vite handles the frontend and Cal.com JavaScript routes. Requests to `/api/chat` are passed to `api/chat.py` through the local adapter. On Vercel, `api/chat.py` runs directly as a Python Function.
